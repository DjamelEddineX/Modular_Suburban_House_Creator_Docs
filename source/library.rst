Library
=======

The Library section displays all available modular parts organized by categories.

How It Works:
- Parts are automatically grouped by their assigned category
- Each category appears as a collapsible section
- Clicking a part name instantiates it in your scene

Example Categories:
- Walls
- Roofs
- Doors
- Windows
- Decorative Elements

Parts remain organized even after adding new assets to your library.
